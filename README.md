# CT-image-reconstruction
The codes implement the CT reconstruction networks described in our peer-reviwed work
"An end-to-end deep network for reconstructing CT images directly from sparse sinograms" submited to IEEE TCI.
The code was written based on  tensorflow2.0.

The sparse matrix AT and inputted sinograms can be downloaded at https://bmitacnz2-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/b0009_onedrive_pet/EjA8T4HBF_hIlI4A5TiH-icBonlrZrW5VWtZ4KcHwug38A?e=sbSsMX
